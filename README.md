RealWeatherSync is a plugin for ETS2 Local Assistant that simulates real-world weather in Euro Truck Simulator 2 based on your in-game position.
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to determine rain, fog, clouds, and temperatures, and dynamically applies these values in the game.

Features:

🌦️ Automatic weather synchronization based on location

☁️ Supports rain, snow, fog, and clouds

🔄 Updates every 5 minutes (adjustable)

✅ Singleplayer-compatible and fully ETS2LA integrated

Note:
TruckersMP blocks weather changes — works there only as an overlay/display.
